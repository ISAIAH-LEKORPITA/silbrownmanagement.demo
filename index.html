<p>Management
Your primary goal is to reduce stress through good management, nutrition and proper health care.
Observe animals daily by looking at their behavior and their movement — watch for any limpers (catch, examine and treat if necessary) and for animals hanging back or that don’t get up to feed.
Gently handle all sheep, refrain from yelling, yanking legs and horns and pulling wool.
When handling sheep, squeeze them into a small space with a gate.
Sheep typically move away from a rattle and a crook. There is no need to hit.
Facilities should include an easy way to catch and restrain animals for observation or treatment.
Provide adequate space for each animal based on its size, breed and other recommendations.
Manage facilities with sanitation and disease prevention in mind.
Clean out pens at least yearly.</p>

Feed the heifer sufficiently to produce normal growth. During the early stage relatively more protein than energy is needed. Most heifers grow well if excellent hay is given as much they can eat. The amount of growth depends upon the quality of forage fed.
The heifers should be provided with a dry shelter free from drafts. A loose housing system with a shelter open to one side is sufficient.</p>
